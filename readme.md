# Calculator in JavaScript

This project is an advanced calculator implemented using JavaScript along with HTML and CSS for the user interface. The calculator is capable of handling basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced operations like exponentiation and square root. 

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are supported.
- **Advanced Operations:** Exponentiation (`**`) and square root operations are also available.
- **Parentheses Support:** The calculator can understand and evaluate expressions containing parentheses, ensuring correct order of operations.

## Implementation

- **HTML & CSS:** The user interface is designed using HTML and styled using CSS to create a clean and user-friendly layout.
- **JavaScript Logic:** JavaScript is used to handle the frontend logic, including parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions entered by the user.
- **Security Considerations:** Measures are taken to ensure security and prevent vulnerabilities, such as input validation and sanitization.

## How to Use

1. Enter a mathematical expression in the input field.
2. Press the "Calculate" button to see the result.
3. The calculator will evaluate the expression and display the result on the screen.

**Note:** While the calculator provides advanced functionality, it's important to exercise caution when evaluating user input, as it can potentially pose security risks if not handled properly.
